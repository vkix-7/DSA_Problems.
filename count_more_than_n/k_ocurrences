/*Given an array arr of size N and an element k. The task is to find the count of elements in the array that appear more than n/k times.

Example :

Input:
N = 8
arr = [3,1,2,2,1,2,3,3]
k = 4
Output: 
2
Explanation: 
In the given array, 3 and 2 are the only elements that appears more than n/k times. */
